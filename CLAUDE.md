# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

AI Connect Africa is a **fully offline AI-powered Learning Operating System**. It runs entirely on-device — no internet, no cloud, no external APIs, ever. Two on-device models are bundled and run locally:

- **Chat/tutor — Qwen3-0.6B (`.litertlm`)** → LiteRT-LM (Google's on-device LLM runtime, via `flutter_gemma`/`flutter_gemma_litertlm`) with GPU/NPU acceleration. One engine, one model file format, identical on **Android, Windows, and Linux** — see `lib/ai_core/inference/litert_lm_engine.dart`. Apache-2.0, no license click-through needed (`litert-community/Qwen3-0.6B` on Hugging Face).
- **Translation — TranslatePsy-AfriSLM (GGUF)** → translates English ↔ 19 Sub-Saharan African languages so students can learn in their own language while the tutor reasons in English. Windows/Linux run it via a local Ollama server; Android runs the GGUF directly through a llama.cpp binding. See `lib/ai_core/inference/ollama_engine.dart` and the Android AfriSLM engine.

Both models expose the same Dart inference interface from `lib/ai_core/inference/inference_engine.dart`. (Chat/Qwen3-0.6B is wired up; the AfriSLM translation engine — Ollama on desktop, llama.cpp on Android — is planned but not yet implemented.)

Target platforms: Android (4 GB RAM / 32 GB storage minimum), Windows (8 GB RAM), Ubuntu (8 GB RAM).

## Core Constraint: Offline-First

Every feature must work with zero network connectivity. Before adding any dependency or API call, verify it works fully offline. This means:

- No calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any hosted LLM API
- No Firebase, Supabase, or cloud sync
- SQLite or local file storage only (no cloud databases)
- Offline STT/TTS only (e.g., Vosk, Coqui, or platform-native offline engines)
- Certificate/badge PDF generation must work locally (e.g., jsPDF, PDFKit)
- Updates deploy via USB drive or local school server, not the internet

## Planned Architecture

When code exists, it will follow this structure:

```
ai-connect-africa/
  apps/
    desktop/          # Electron app (Windows + Ubuntu)
    android/          # React Native or Flutter app
  packages/
    ai-core/          # Local LLM inference wrapper — LiteRT-LM on Android, llama.cpp on desktop
    learning-engine/  # Learning paths, adaptive logic, mode routing
    memory-engine/    # Student profile, compressed summaries, local storage
    voice/            # Offline STT + TTS integration
    simulation/       # Domain simulations (science, math, business, etc.)
    gamification/     # Points, badges, streaks, achievements
    certification/    # Offline PDF certificate generation
    collaboration/    # Local network peer collaboration (no internet)
    safety/           # Emotional safety detection, prompt safety
  data/
    models/           # GGUF model files (gitignored, distributed separately)
    knowledge/        # Seed curriculum content
```

## AI Tutor Behavior Contract

Every AI response must follow this pipeline — do not short-circuit it:

```
Answer → Clarify → Practice → Apply → Create → Reflect
```

OTIC is a mentor, not a search engine. It must never stop at answering.

## Learning Modes

Five modes are routed through the same AI pipeline:

| Mode     | Purpose                        | Outcome            |
|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Learn    | Understand concepts            | Conceptual clarity |
| Practice | Exercises, challenges          | Retention          |
| Apply    | Real-world scenarios           | Practical competence |
| Create   | Build projects                 | Creation           |
| Teach    | Student explains → OTIC scores | Mastery            |

## User Roles

`Guest` → `Student` → `Teacher` → `Admin`

- Guests: no saved state, no certificates, demonstration only
- Students: full learning features, memory, certificates
- Teachers: read student data, create groups/quizzes, cannot modify platform
- Admins: device/user/update management, no learning features

## Student Memory Engine

Store compressed summaries only — never full conversation logs. Stored fields: age, interests, learning style, strengths, weaknesses, projects, achievements, certificates, progress, goals. Storage is local SQLite per device.

## Voice Learning

- Use offline STT/TTS only (no cloud speech APIs)
- Store converted text only — never store audio recordings

## AI Model Files

Model files are large and distributed separately (USB / local server, never via internet). They must be gitignored.

| Role | Platform | Format | Model | Size |
|------|----------|--------|-------|------|
| Chat/tutor | Android, Windows, Linux | `.litertlm` (LiteRT-LM) | Qwen3-0.6B | ~330–590 MB |
| Translation | Windows / Linux | GGUF 4-bit (Ollama) | TranslatePsy-AfriSLM 0.8B Q4 | ~0.5–1 GB |
| Translation | Android | GGUF 4-bit (llama.cpp) | TranslatePsy-AfriSLM 0.8B Q4 | ~0.5–1 GB |

The app must detect whether the model file is present at startup and show a clear "Model not installed — transfer via USB" screen rather than failing silently.

## Local History (Student Memory)

Use SQLite via the `drift` Flutter package. Store compressed summaries only — never full conversation logs. One database file per device, never synced.

Stored fields: `userId`, `age`, `interests`, `learningStyle`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `activeProjects`, `achievements`, `certificates`, `progressByTopic`, `goals`, `lastActive`.

## Update Mechanism

Updates ship as packages deployable via USB flash drive or a local school LAN server. The app must support applying an update bundle without internet access.

## Development Commands

```powershell
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Windows desktop (primary dev target)
flutter run -d windows

# Run on Android device/emulator
flutter run -d android

# Build release
flutter build windows
flutter build apk

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test

# After adding a new package to pubspec.yaml
flutter pub get
```

Flutter SDK is installed at the path managed by winget (`Google.Flutter`).
After install, PATH must include the Flutter `bin` directory — open a new terminal if `flutter` is not found.

## What to Build First

Follow this order — do not jump ahead to gamification or certificates before the core tutor works:

1. Local LLM integration (Qwen3-0.6B loading + inference via LiteRT-LM)
2. Basic Learn mode (ask question → get mentor response)
3. Student memory (profile creation + summary storage)
4. Learning paths (auto-generate curriculum for a topic)
5. Practice + Apply modes
6. Voice learning
7. Simulation engine
8. Create + Teach modes
9. Gamification + Certification
10. Teacher dashboard
11. Admin dashboard
12. Collaboration (local network)
13. Emotional safety engine
14. Android app
15. Update deployment tooling
